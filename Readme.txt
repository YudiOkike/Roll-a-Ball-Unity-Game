## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/YudiOkike/Roll-a-Ball.git
$ cd Roll-a-Ball
```

### 2. Open in Unity
1. Launch Unity Hub and click on 'Open Project'.
2. Navigate to the 'Roll a ball' directory and select it.
3. Unity will load the project, and you can start exploring the scenes and scripts.

### 3. Build and Play
1. Open the 'Minigame' scene located in `Assets/Scenes/Minigame.unity`.
2. Click on 'File'  'Build Settings'.
3. Choose the target platform (e.g., macOS, Windows) and click 'Build'.
4. Run the executable to start playing!

## 🎨 Customization Tips

- **Ball Color**: Modify the material color in `Assets/Materials/Background.mat` to change the ball's appearance.
- **Speed Adjustment**: Tweak the speed variable within `Assets/Scripts/PlayerController.cs` for desired gameplay pacing.
- **Camera Control**: Adjust camera smoothness in `CameraController.cs` for different visual dynamics.

## 📈 Learning Outcomes

- Developing interactive gaming experiences using Unity’s engine
- Understanding core principles of physics-based game mechanics
- Implementing robust UI elements with TextMeshPro
- Customizing gameplay dynamics using C# scripting
