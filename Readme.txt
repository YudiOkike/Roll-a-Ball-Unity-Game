Name: Udochukwu John-bright Okike

Time Spent: I spent approximately 2 hours working on this assignment.

Usefulness of the Assignment:

The assignment was very useful for several reasons:

	1.	Hands-On Experience with Unity: It provided a great opportunity to learn how to work with Unity’s game development engine, especially for building simple 3D applications like the roll-a-ball game.
	2.	Introduction to Game Mechanics: It introduced me to key concepts like object manipulation, physics, and collision detection, which are essential for game development.
	3.	TextMeshPro Integration: I also learned how to work with Unity’s TextMeshPro system, which is an industry-standard tool for handling text in games, improving the overall user interface.
	4.	Basic Scripting: I was able to apply basic C# scripting to control the ball’s movement, interact with game objects, and manage user inputs.

Challenges:

	1.	Text Component Issues: I initially faced difficulties with referencing the Text component in the script. Specifically, I was unable to drag and drop the Text object into the Inspector. This issue was resolved by ensuring I was using the correct TextMeshPro (TMP_Text) type and importing the correct namespace (using TMPro;).
	2.	Updating TextMeshPro: Another challenge was switching from the standard Unity Text component to TextMeshPro, which required some adjustments in the script and in the Unity Editor.
	3.	Tutorial Was Outdated: The tutorial was quite old (around 8 years ago), so some instructions didn’t match the current version of Unity. This led to some challenges while following along, such as differences in the interface and features that have been updated or replaced since the tutorial was created.
	4.	Compiling and Inspector Issues: At one point, the Inspector didn’t update when I added new variables in the script, but I resolved it by ensuring that all fields were public or serialized correctly.

Changes I Made:

For personalization, I changed the color of the ball and adjusted the camera movement to follow the ball more smoothly. Additionally, I customized the gameplay by altering the ball’s speed to make the game more challenging.
